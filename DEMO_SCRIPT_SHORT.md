# GhostMove - Quick Demo Script (3-4 minutes)

## 🎬 Introduction (0:00 - 0:20)
"Hi! I'm [Name]. Today I'm showing **GhostMove** - a privacy-first pizza delivery platform on **Aleo blockchain** that uses **zero-knowledge proofs** to match riders and drivers **without tracking locations or storing phone numbers**."

---

## 🎯 The Problem (0:20 - 0:40)
"Traditional delivery apps track your location, store your phone number, and create permanent data trails. **GhostMove solves this** using Aleo's zero-knowledge cryptography."

---

## 💡 The Solution (0:40 - 1:00)
"GhostMove has **2 smart contracts** on Aleo:
1. **Proximity Matching** - Matches riders with nearby drivers using ZK proofs
2. **Ride Identity** - Creates temporary identities that expire after delivery

**Everything is private by default** - no location tracking, no phone numbers."
